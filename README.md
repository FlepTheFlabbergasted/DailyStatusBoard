# DailyStatusBoard

DailyStatusBoard is a tool to help in agile project development using scrum. The tool is to have something concrete to keep tabs on how things are going. The tool should be used right after the daily scrum, every team member gets a turn to give either a + or -, depending on how yesterdays workday was. It is important to motivate why a plus or minus is chosen, *there is no "in between" + or -*. 

This can help in finding problems/disturbances in a developers everyday workday, stuff like <STUFF>. But the main function of a tool like this is to lift everyday good things. It's too easy to focus on only the bad stuff, a bug here and there, management sucks etc. By motivating why yesterday was a good day, fun and good things come into the light and the week gets a little more bright.
